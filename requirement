Your project will be assessed based on the following criteria (total 100%):

Done (10%) - User account (account creation, sign-in/sign-out)
Done (10%) - Allowing users to add new items (notes/photos) to their own account
Done (10%) - Allowing users to list the items they have added
Done (10%) - Allowing users to remove items they have added
Done (10%) - Allowing users to search for items using keywords
Done (10%) - Using caching in appropriate places to improve performance -- in profile image list
(30%) - Additional feature and a method to enable scaling of the system
(10%) - Load testing report
In particular, for load testing, you should use a load testing tool to test your application's search API. Plot the distributions of response times of requests under different load conditions (10, 50, 100, 500 concurrent users).

You should also prepare a brief report (up to 5 pages or 1,000 words) of your project, which should include the following items:

Description of your system's architecture with diagram(s)
Description of the additional feature your have implemented
Description of how you have implemented the additional feature such that it can be easily scaled
Your load testing results


In addition, you will have to implement an additional feature of your choice, some ideas include:

Done  A social network (e.g. allow users to follow or be friend with one another, seeing each other's resources)
Recommendations (e.g. generating related items for the user based on some similarity measures)
Email digest (e.g. sending email to the user periodically or on request about any update in the system)
